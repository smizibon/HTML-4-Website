<h2> Starting and Stopping Commands </h2>

<p> Most HTML commands come in pairs: for example, &quot;&lt;H4&gt;&quot; marks the beginning of a size 4
    heading, and &quot;&lt;/H4&gt;&quot; marks the end of it. The closing command is always the same as the
    opening command, except for the addition of the &quot;/&quot;
</p>

<p> Modifiers are sometimes included along with the basic commadn, inside the opening commands 
    &lt;&gt;. The modifier does not need to be repeated in the closing command.
