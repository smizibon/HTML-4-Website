<h2> Line Breaks </h2>

<p> HTML doesn't normally use line breaks for ordinary text. A white space of any size is treated as 
    a single space. This is because the author of the page has no way of knowing the size of the
    reader's screen, or what size type they will have their browser set for.
</p>

<p> If you want to put a line break at a particular place, you can use the &quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot; command, or, for a
    paragraph break, the &quot;&lt;P&gt;&quot; command, which will insert a blank line. The heading command
    (&quot;&lt;H4&gt;&lt;/H4&gt;&quot;) puts a blank line above and below the heading text.
